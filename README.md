# Discord Crypto Price Bot

A simple discord bot that listens for all buy/sell swaps of a particular crypto trading pair. Currently set for WAVAX-CCC pair but can be updated to be any pair on the avalanche blockchain. You can also set a minimum amount threshold (e.g. 2 Avax) for the bot to send posts to a discord channel to filter out any small transactions. Bot configuration is currently built for avalanche chain but can be updated to any chain with slight configuration changes to the respective transactions explorer website.

## Quickstart
